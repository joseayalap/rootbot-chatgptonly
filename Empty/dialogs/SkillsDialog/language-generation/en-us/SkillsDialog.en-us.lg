    text = Hi ${turn.activity.from.name}, I'm an intelligent GPT-based bot ready to interact with CEMEX users in a secure way, even when prompted with CEMEX related data. Please note that each prompt I handle currently has a limit of around 2000 words. You can say "Hi" to show the home menu or "Bye" to end the conversation. I keep previous context of conversations until they are ended.  It's important to know that I am using the public ChatGPT model, which provides responses based on its training data and algorithms. While I strive to provide the most accurate and relevant information possible, please exercise caution and use your own discretion when applying the information provided by ChatGPT. Let me know how I can assist you today.
